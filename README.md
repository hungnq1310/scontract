# scontract
This repository contains a collection of various Solidity smart contract projects and examples. It includes implementations for ERC721 tokens, faucets, NFT collections, CRUD operations, and other smart contract patterns.

## Overview

This workspace serves as a monorepo for multiple Solidity-based projects, each potentially having its own development and deployment lifecycle. Key areas explored include:
*   Token standards (ERC721, potentially others).
*   Decentralized application (dApp) components like faucets (see `projects/faucet_final/`).
*   Smart contract data management (see `projects/project2_crud/`).
*   Individual Solidity files for experimentation (see `remix/`).

Many projects utilize the Truffle suite for development, testing, and deployment. Some projects, like `projects/faucet_final/`, also include frontend components (e.g., React).

## Directory Structure

*   `ganache-2.7.1-linux-x86_64.AppImage`: A local blockchain for development and testing.
*   `projects/`: Contains individual, self-contained smart contract projects.
    *   `erc721token/`: An example of an ERC721 non-fungible token.
    *   `faucet_final/`: A project implementing a token faucet, likely with a web interface.
    *   `nft_collection/`: A project focused on creating and managing an NFT collection.
    *   `openzeppelin-contracts/`: A submodule or copy of OpenZeppelin contracts, a library for secure smart contract development.
    *   `project1/`: A generic project placeholder.
    *   `project2_crud/`: Demonstrates Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations within a smart contract.
    *   `token_binance/`: A project related to a token, potentially for the Binance Smart Chain or involving Binance-related standards.
*   `remix/`: A collection of individual Solidity files (`.sol`), possibly used for quick prototyping or testing with the Remix IDE. Examples include `auction.sol`, `firstcoin.sol`, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (e.g., v16.x or later)
*   npm or yarn (Node.js package managers)
*   Truffle (Solidity development framework): `npm install -g truffle` or use via `npx`
*   A local blockchain environment like `Ganache` (an AppImage is provided in the root) or `Hardhat`.
*   A Solidity compiler (usually managed by Truffle or other frameworks).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/scontract.git
    cd scontract
    ```
2.  Install dependencies for projects with a `package.json` file (e.g., `projects/faucet_final/`):
    Navigate into the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    # Example for faucet_final
    cd projects/faucet_final
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    cd ../.. # Navigate back to the root
    ```
    Repeat for other projects as needed. Some projects might rely on global installations or Truffle's internal dependencies.

## Usage

Most projects within the `projects/` directory are structured as Truffle projects.

### Compiling Contracts

Navigate to the specific project directory you want to work with:
```bash
cd projects/<project_name> # e.g., cd projects/project2_crud
truffle compile
```

### Running Tests

Navigate to the specific project directory:
```bash
cd projects/<project_name> # e.g., cd projects/project2_crud
truffle test
```
Test files are typically located in the `test/` subfolder of each project (e.g., [`projects/project2_crud/test/1_crud_test.js`](projects/project2_crud/test/1_crud_test.js)).

### Deployment

Deployment typically uses Truffle migrations with Ganache network. Ensure your `truffle-config.js` within the specific project (e.g., [`projects/erc721token/truffle-config.js`](projects/erc721token/truffle-config.js)) is configured for your target network (development, testnet, mainnet).

Navigate to the specific project directory:
```bash
cd projects/<project_name>
truffle migrate --network <your_network_name>
```

### Running Frontend Applications

For projects with a frontend (e.g., `projects/faucet_final/` which appears to be a Create React App):
Navigate to the project's frontend directory (e.g., `projects/faucet_final/`):
```bash
cd projects/faucet_final
npm start
```
This will typically start a development server, and you can view the application in your browser (often at `http://localhost:3000`). Refer to the specific project's `README.md` (e.g., [`projects/faucet_final/README.md`](projects/faucet_final/README.md)) for more details.
